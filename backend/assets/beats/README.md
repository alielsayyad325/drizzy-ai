2. Update `catalog.json` with the beat metadata:
   - `name`: Display name
   - `file`: Filename
   - `bpm`: Beats per minute
   - `mood`: Mood tag (hype, chill, aggressive, sad, romantic)
   - `duration_seconds`: Length in seconds

2. Name them according to the catalog
3. Or update the catalog to match your beat files
